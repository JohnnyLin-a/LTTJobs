# LTTJobs

Jobs hunt script built to scrape Linus Media Group job postings.

Please visit https://www.lttstore.com/ and get a water bottle to stay hydrated =)

This tiny script was made for fun, to help notify about new job opportunities at Linus Media Group.

### Setup:
1. Install Node, pref. version 16.x or latest lts
2. Run `npm i`
4. (Optional) Run `export DISCORD_WEBHOOK="your_discord_webhook_here"` or have `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as an environment variable. (Replace `your_discord_webhook_here` by your own discord webhook)
3. Run `node main.js`
